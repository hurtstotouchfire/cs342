1) Define the following Terms (As used in Java) (10 points each):

A. protected

B. static

C. new

D. interface

E. abstract

2) Write a Java program that plays the game I am thinking of a number between 1 

and 1000. The computer will think of the number, and the user will repeatedly 

guess until they answer correctly. The program will tell the user if guesses are too 

high or too low. This only needs be a console game; no extra credit will be given 

for a graphical implementation.

When the user guesses the correct number, the game should show the user how 

many turns it took. You must handle incorrect input (letters when numbers were 

wanted). You should hand in hard copy code for this problem, and hard copy 

output from 2 runs of the program. (50 Points)
